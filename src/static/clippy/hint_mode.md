# Hint mode

There are many different hint submodes. They all follow a similar pattern: hinting modes display characters above various elements on the screen, which you can type to perform actions using those elements. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)

Here are some of the most useful hint modes:

*   `:hint -b` or `F`: open link in background
*   `:hint -y` or `;y`: copy link location to clipboard
*   `:hint -p` or `;p`: copy element text (such as a paragraph) to clipboard
*   `:hint -#` or `;#`: copy anchor location. Useful for linking someone to a specific part of a page.
*   `:hint -k` or `;k`: kill an element. Very satisfying.

If there is ever only a single hint remaining (for example, because you have wittled them down, or there is only a single link visible on the page) the hint mode will follow it automatically.

The [next page](./command_mode.html) will cover the command mode. <a href='./normal_mode.html' rel="prev"></a>
