# Tridactyl changelog

## Release 1.10.0 (beta) - TBC

- Native messenger! Run `:installnative` to install, then:
    - `<Ctrl-E>` in a text field will open Vim, probably. Set it with `set editorcmd` but make sure that the command stays in the foreground till the programme is exited.
    - Not all text fields work yet (esp CodeMirror), so make sure you test it before writing war and peace.
    - `:! [shell command]` or `:exclaim [shell command]` will run the command and give you STDOUT/STDERR back in the command line.
        - Pipes work but redirection probably doesn't.
        - You can't use composite and shell pipes together yet.
    - `hint -W exclaim mpv` works particularly well.

## Release 1.9.8 - 2018-04-26 12:19 UTC

- Make error reporting to command line less fussy
- Fix error reporting loop with `noiframeon`

## Release 1.9.7 - 2018-04-25 19:37 UTC

- Load iframe more lazily to stop breakage on some sites
- Add setting `noiframeon` for websites that are still broken by our iframe ("ServiceNow", for example: #279)
    - Simply `set noiframeon [space separated URLs]` to blacklist URLs
- This will hopefully be our final release before the native messenger for OSX and Linux is merged.
    - If you'd like to help test it out, download our latest betas from [here](https://tridactyl.cmcaine.co.uk/betas) and run `:installnative` once you are in.
